# 🔮 LLM Oracle 2026

LLM Oracle 2026 is a high-fidelity benchmarking dashboard designed to track and verify the predictive capabilities of frontier Artificial Intelligence models. 

On January 3rd, 2026, we queried the world's most advanced Large Language Models (LLMs)—including **Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, Perplexity, and Grok**—to generate strategic forecasts across three distinct scopes: **Brazil, Global, and Geopolitics**.

This project moves beyond simple "chatting" to evaluate **Synthetic Intuition**: the ability of models to synthesize vast amounts of training data and real-time signals into accurate probabilistic forecasts of high-volatility events.

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Real-time Tracking**: Monitor the status of 36+ predictions as they are "Confirmed," "Debunked," or remain "Ongoing."
- **Deep Dive Analysis**: Each prediction includes the model's specific reasoning, strategic analysis, and an AI-provided confidence score (0-100%).
- **Performance Analytics**: Visual distribution of model confidence and thematic focus areas (Politics, AI, Crypto, War, etc.).
- **Strategic Scopes**: Specialized views for Brazilian domestic issues, Global trends, and the shifting sands of Geopolitics.
- **Admin Interface**: A secure "Oracle State" management system to verify outcomes as history unfolds.

## 📊 Methodology

1. **Snapshot Capture**: All predictions were generated on **January 3rd, 2026**, creating an immutable "time capsule" of AI foresight before the events actually transpired.
2. **Synthetic Intuition**: Models were prompted to provide not just a guess, but a reasoned strategic analysis and a self-calibrated confidence score.
3. **Calibration Tracking**: We measure not just *if* a model was right, but how well-calibrated its confidence was (e.g., do 90% confidence predictions succeed more often than 50% ones?).
4. **Independent Verification**: Status updates are performed based on verified global news and primary data sources.
